This simple axon-soma model explained how the rapid rising phase in
somatic spike is derived from propagated axon initiated spike.

Creates a single cell containing a dendrite, soma, an axon with 60
micrometer and a axon bleb to investigate generation of spike kink at
soma. As observed in experiment, spikes are usually initiated at the
axon site 40~70 micrometer away from soma.  There is a rapid rising
phase in somatic spike, due to the initial segment traveling spike.

After running the code, there is an output data file called
'neuron_soma.dat' Use the matlab code for_plot_spike.m to plot the
somatic spike and axon spike.
